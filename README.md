**ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS PUBLIC LICENSE (ACAB-1.0)**

copies of this license document, and changing it is allowed.

Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this work for  
any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted.

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS WORK INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS WORK.

## Why ACAB?

The spirit of the license is to let people know that the users of this license will not threaten people with the violence of cops to people who copy, modify, and/or distribute works with or without fee.
It simply removes all legal threats to people who obtain a copy of the work, because legal threats can end with death if a cop is involved.
The name also filters out people who support cops and their actions.
The name also lets people who say "ACAB" that any license that creates legal restrictions is a license that threatens to use police violence, so they should be persuaded to use a _restrictionless_ license such as this one. The name also keeps this license out of suits' hands, which is always a plus :)

## What does it do?

It is very much in the same spirit of the [WTFPL](http://wtfpl.net), but with even less restrictions.
It is effectively the same as the [WTFPL v69.420](https://www.github.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420) that I made, but with streamlined text.
